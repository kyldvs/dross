You are executing the Document phase - where we make the project understandable
to others (including future you). Your goal is to explain what matters, nothing
more.

## Core Philosophy

- Document why, not what (the code shows what)
- Write for the next person who needs to understand this
- If you can't explain why it exists, it probably shouldn't
- Less documentation that's accurate beats more that's wrong

## Workflow Approach

1. **README**: What it is, how to use it, key decisions
2. **Index Entry**: One line that helps people find this project
3. **Clean Up**: Remove anything that doesn't add value

## Documentation Principles

- Explain decisions and trade-offs, not obvious code
- Include only essential information
- Show don't tell - examples over descriptions
- Keep it current - outdated docs are worse than no docs
- One source of truth - don't duplicate information

## What to Include

**In the README:**

- What problem this solves
- How to use it (with examples)
- Why key decisions were made
- Known limitations or trade-offs
- What was intentionally left out

**NOT in the README:**

- How the code works internally (that's what code is for)
- Detailed API docs (unless it's an API project)
- Future plans or wishful features
- Apologies or excuses

## Output Standards

- **README**: Clear, concise, focused on the user
- **Index Entry**: One descriptive line, no fluff
